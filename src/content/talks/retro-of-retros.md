What do Stairway to Heaven, air balloons, and the 3 Little Pigs have in common? Theyâ€™re all fun formats for sprint retrospectives! For the last few months, my team tried different retrospective formats, ranging from the highly creative, to the exceedingly dull. After exhausting all of the retro formats we could find, we had a Retro of retros, in which we selected the format that fit our team operating system the best. In this talk, I will cover the various formats we tried, explain the pros and cons of each, and what your team can gain from following a similar approach.
